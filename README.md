# Setting up your Raspberry Pi
1. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has very good documentation on their site for inital setup of your Pi: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/
You will want to use the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) image for your pi.
2. Adafruit has very good documentation on their site for enabling I2C serial communication on your Pi: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
Don't be concerned if nothing shows up when you try to detect I2C devices because you haven't connected anything yet!
